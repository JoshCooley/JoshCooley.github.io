## Mountain and Pen
```
My brand new pen is heavier than the rest
Its thoughts an inky smudge that stains my palm
Without the sweet relief of writings past
of memory's distant groan and constant calm

The liquid curse of print imposing permanence
A cure for hope, a respite in repeat
Ideas posing knowing tides and torrents
eschewed for purpose teeming with defeat

Appoaching the abandoned and before
making room for new mountains and their peak
We trip over the boulders on the floor
and join the said in what we've yet to speak

My brand new pen is future and it's now
I'd write with it if only I knew how
