## Mountain and Pen
```
My brand new pen is heavier than the rest
Its thoughts an inky smudge that stains my palm
Without the sweet relief of writings past
of memory's distant groan and constant calm

The liquid curse of print imposing permanence
A cure for hope, a respite in repeat
Ideas posing knowing tides and torrents
eschewed for purpose teeming with defeat

Appoaching the abandoned and before
making room for new mountains and their peak
We trip over the boulders on the floor
and join the said in what we've yet to speak

My brand new pen is future and it's now
I'd write with it if only I knew how
```

## Get outta here, you!
```
Mockingbird won't stop
territorial shrieking
No more worms for you

## No Help from Tap or Grip
```
Knowing her hate altogether
he asked her in hunger if ever
  she'd put her hand in his
  so they could both give a twist
and open these pickles together

## It does no good in the house
```
        why is
      this thing
     never where I
  need it? I'm in see
 through pants with no
